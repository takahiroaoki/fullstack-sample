# fullstack-sample
This is a typical full-stack sample project written in Java and TypeScript.
The modules or applications in this repository are supposed to share the same database.

## Requirement
- Docker Desktop
- VSCode & Dev Container Extension

â€»The maintainer uses codespaces.

## Modules
### data-layer
A Maven project that contains common modules for data layer like mappers, entities, enums etc.
Basically these parts are generated by mybatis-generator.

Because the modules of this repository share one database, the directory of "data-layer" also should be one.

### app
A sample Maven project for web application.
This type of directory should be made for each application server.
I mean, if there are some web applications on the same database, the directories would become "app-1", "app-2" etc.
Of course the directory names are your own.


## Tech Stack
### Frontend
Your can choose any tech stack.

### Backend
I recommend use the following tech stack because all application can share mappers, entitis and enums in data-layer.
- Java
- MyBatis
- Apache Maven

### Infra
For example,
- MySQL
- Redis

## Development
See README.md in each module.
