# project-format
This is a typical project written in Java.
The modules or applications in this repository are supposed to share the same database.

You can also make directory in this repository which contains front application without any databases.

## Requirement
- Docker Desktop

## Modules
### data-layer
A Maven project that contains common modules for data layer like mappers, entities, enums etc.
Basically these parts are generated by mybatis-generator.

Because the modules of this repository share one database, the directory of "data-layer" also should be one.

This directory can contain proto file of gRPC.

### app
A sample Maven project for web application.
This type of directory should be made for each application server.
I mean, if there are some web applications on the same database, the directories would become "app-1", "app-2" etc.
Of course the directory names are your own.


## Tech Stack
### Frontend
Your can choose any tech stack.

### Backend
I recommend use the following tech stack because all application can share mappers, entitis and enums in data-layer.
- Java
- MyBatis
- Apache Maven

### Infra
For example,
- MySQL
- Redis

## Development
See README.md in each module.
